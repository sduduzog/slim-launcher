# Contributions


## 1. Issues
-  Create an issue with suggestions for what to change, or do so yourself.
- Within the scope of what the app is, features will be added in the next release following friendly discussion.
- Help is needed anywhere you see fit, please do.

## 2. Code reviews/new PRs etc
- I think anyone can contribute, at least, not even writing a single line of code, any open pull request is open for discussion. If you want to submit a new pull request, open an issue for it, 
if it doesn't exist already. 
- When I'm working on something big (new features maybe), I'll probably have a PR for it. If you want to help me out, you can create a pull request against that feature branch, I'd appreciate that a lot.
- Also I'm working on [v3.0](https://github.com/sduduzog/slim-launcher/pull/98) and I think it'll be cool to collaborate with strangers on it :)

### Forked this project?
- I'd love to stay up to date with the many variations that exist out there that spawned from this project. Please consider adding a PR to update this README with your project.
- But it has to at least adhere to the following:
  - It has to be pretty much actively maintained
  - If not distributed on Google Play, it has to be in F-Droid

### Running/Writing tests
- Unit tests use robolectric to run tests on the VM and it currently works with [Java11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html) for me and does not work with anything below that.
- The project though doesn't complain about the jdk version you're using as far as project development is concerned.
- The point of reintroducing tests to the project is to make sure that there's less brittle parts around the app as more and more tests are added.
- When submitting a PR, for now you don't really have to write unit tests or anything but if you can, please do, but existing tests should not be removed just to pass the build once hooked up to the CI.

## 3. [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoff.ee/sduduzog)
- Motivation to work on this app comes from the great feedback I receive from the reviews on the Play Store and the e-mails, and in some special cases, as coffee :)
- The fact that someone out there noticed the little effort that I put into this project gives me all the drive I need to type away at it time and time again.

Thank you to everyone that contributed to the project and my growth as a developer and a maintainer.
